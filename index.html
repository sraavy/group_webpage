    <p>
      Hi, I’m Sraavya Idumudi, a senior at UNCC majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Science and a minor in Management Information Systems.
      I moved to Charlotte from Minnesota four years ago. I love cooking different cuisines, traveling around the world, reading, and hanging out with my friends on the lake.
      After graduation, I’ll be working full-time as a Software Engineer at Lowe’s!
